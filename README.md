# Dada Mail German E-Mail themes

## How to Install

Download all folders/themes you like to use and upload them to your Dada Mail installation at:

1. `dada_mail_support_files > themes > email`
2. Select your prevered theme in the `Dada Mail Admin Panel > Appeareance > EMail Themes`

## Steps after a Dada Mail update

I recomend to download the current version of the translation on [this repository](https://github.com/holzhannes/dada_mail_email_themes-de-formal) and do the same steps as if installing the EMail Themes. In most cases it will also work if you just move the files in `dada_mail_support_files > themes-backup-LAST_DATE-TIME > email` to `dada_mail_support_files > themes > email`.
